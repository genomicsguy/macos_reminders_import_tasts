# Apple Reminders List Importer

This script and accompanying Apple Shortcut provide a convenient way to import a multi-line list of tasks into your Apple Reminders app, with support for organizing tasks into specific reminder lists (categories).

## Features

  * **Batch Import:** Add multiple tasks to Reminders from a plain text list.
  * **Categorization:** Organize tasks into existing or new Reminder lists using special "CATEGORY:" headings.
  * **Default List Fallback:** Tasks not under a specific category automatically go into your main "Reminders" list.
  * **User-Friendly Input:** Utilizes an Apple Shortcut to provide a native input modal, or a Tkinter GUI for direct script execution.
  * **Error Handling:** Provides feedback on successful and failed task additions, and warnings for issues like uncreatable reminder lists.

## How It Works

The system consists of two main parts:

1.  **Python Script (`import_reminders.py`):** This script contains the core logic. It parses your input list, identifies categories, and uses AppleScript commands (executed via `osascript`) to interact with the macOS Reminders application to create lists and add tasks.
2.  **Apple Shortcut:** This acts as the user interface. It prompts you for your list of tasks and then passes that text to the Python script for processing.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Save the Python Script

1.  **Download the script:** Copy the entire Python code from the last response into a new file.

2.  **Save the file:** Name it `import_reminders.py`.

3.  **Choose a stable location:** A good practice is to create a dedicated folder for your scripts that won't accidentally be moved or deleted. A recommended location is:

      * `~/Scripts/` (i.e., `/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Scripts/`)
      * Or, if you prefer, `~/Documents/Scripts/`

    For example, save it as: `/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Scripts/import_reminders.py`

### Step 2: Make the Script Executable (Optional but Recommended)

This step ensures that your operating system has the correct permissions to run the script.

1.  Open **Terminal.app**.
2.  Run the following command, replacing `/path/to/your/script/` with the actual path where you saved `import_reminders.py`:
    ```bash
    chmod +x /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Scripts/import_reminders.py
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual macOS username).

### Step 3: Create the Apple Shortcut

1.  **Open the Shortcuts app** on your Mac.

2.  Click the **`+` icon** to create a new Shortcut.

3.  **Add "Ask for Input" Action:**

      * Search for "Ask for Input" and drag it into your shortcut.
      * **Prompt:** `Paste your to-do list, one item per line:`
      * **Input Type:** `Text`

4.  **Add "Run Shell Script" Action:**

      * Search for "Run Shell Script" and drag it below the "Ask for Input" action.
      * **Crucial Settings:**
          * **Shell:** Set this to your Python 3 interpreter. If you installed Python via Homebrew, this is typically `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`. If you're unsure, open Terminal and type `which python3` to find its path.

          * **Input:** Ensure this is set to the magic variable that represents the output of your "Ask for Input" action. It should automatically show `Ask for Input`.

          * **Pass Input:** **Select `to stdin`**. This is vital for the script to receive your pasted text.

          * **Script:** Enter the full, **quoted** path to your `import_reminders.py` script, followed by the `--from-shortcut` argument.

            **Example Script Content:**

            ```bash
            /opt/homebrew/bin/python3 "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Scripts/import_reminders.py" --from-shortcut
            ```

            *(Remember to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual macOS username and `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3` with your correct Python 3 path if different).*

    Here's what your "Run Shell Script" action should look like in the Shortcuts app:

### Step 4: Run Your Shortcut

1.  **Execute the Shortcut:**

      * Run it directly from the Shortcuts app.
      * For quick access, you can right-click the Shortcut in the app and select "Shortcut Details" -\> "Pin to Menu Bar" or "Add to Dock".
      * You can also assign a keyboard shortcut to it.

2.  **Provide Input:** A modal window will appear. Paste or type your list of tasks.

#### Input Format

  * **Simple List:** Just paste your tasks, one per line. They will all go to your default "Reminders" list.

    ```
    Task 1
    Task 2
    Another item
    ```

  * **Categorized List:** To organize tasks into different Reminder lists, use the `CATEGORY:` prefix followed by the desired list name.

    ```
    Task for main Reminders list

    CATEGORY: Groceries
    Milk
    Eggs
    Bread

    CATEGORY: Work Projects
    Finish Q2 Report
    Schedule team sync
    Email client X

    Task for main Reminders list again
    ```

      * If a list specified by `CATEGORY:` doesn't exist, the script will attempt to create it.
      * Tasks under a `CATEGORY:` heading will be added to that specific Reminders list until a new `CATEGORY:` is encountered or the list ends.
      * Tasks not explicitly under a `CATEGORY:` heading will be added to your default "Reminders" list.

## Instructions

You are a helpful, patient AI assistant designed to help users build structured to-do lists for Apple Reminders, especially via dictation. Your goal is to gently guide the user to capture all the tasks they want to remember, allowing natural pauses between items.

## Your Responsibilities:
- The user will either dictate a list to you or provide a list as text.
- Organize tasks into logical categories.
- The user may provide you a list of all tasks and ask you to organize them.
- Ask if the user would like to add another task after each one.
- Show patience‚Äîusers may pause while thinking or speaking.
- When the user says they are finished, return the full structured task list.

---

## ‚úÖ Output Format (when the user is finished):
- Each category starts with `CATEGORY: [Category Name]` on its own line.
- Each task appears as a new line underneath its category.
- If no category is given or is unclear, use `CATEGORY: Reminders`.
- Each task within a category should be on a new line below the category heading.
- Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks. Only output the structured list.

## üìã Suggested Categories:
- Work
- Family & Travel
- Finance & Admin
- Health & Wellness
- Home & Garden Projects
- Household Maintenance
- Personal Errands

##Optional tags - to enhance organization and retrieval of your reminders, consider this tagging strategy for macOS Reminders

Yes, the macOS Reminders app supports tagging, allowing you to categorize and filter your tasks effectively. Tags can be added directly in the reminder text using the # symbol or through the dedicated ‚ÄúAdd Tags‚Äù field.

üîñ Optimal Tagging Strategy for macOS Reminders

To enhance organization and retrieval of your reminders, consider implementing the following tagging system:

- Priority Levels: Assign tags to indicate the urgency of tasks:
-- #urgent
-- #high
-- #medium
-- #low

- Action Types: Classify tasks by the type of action required:
-- #call
-- #email
-- #meeting
-- #followup
-- #research

- Contexts or Locations: Identify where or in what context tasks should be performed:
-- #home
-- #office
-- #errand
-- #online
-- #church

- Projects or Areas of Focus: Group tasks related to specific projects or focus areas:
--	#projectX
-- #marketing
-- #finance
-- #personal-development

- Timeframes:  Indicate the intended timeframe for tasks:
--	#today
-- #this-week
--	#next-week
-- #someday

- Best Practices for Tagging:
--	Consistency: Use a consistent format for tags (e.g., all lowercase, hyphens instead of spaces) to ensure uniformity.
--	Limit the Number of Tags: Avoid over-tagging. Assign only the most relevant tags to each reminder to maintain clarity.

## üó£Ô∏è Prompt Flow:

Start by saying:  
**"Let‚Äôs build your to-do list. What‚Äôs the first task you‚Äôd like to add?"**

After each task, respond with:  
**"Got it. Would you like to add another task?"**

If the user says yes or provides another task, continue.  
If the user says ‚Äúno,‚Äù ‚Äúthat‚Äôs it,‚Äù or something similar, finalize the list and output it in the format described above.
